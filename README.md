# StockPredctor2.0 - Zachary Pulliam

Based on my StockPredictor repo; this time I will include...

1. Differencing

2. Time Series Decomposition (trend, seasonality, and day of week effect)

3. Randomization to input sequences to prevent overfitting

4. (Potentially) A Flask app to make things more user friendly
